SubsetCSS is all about limiting yourself and/or your team to a subset of CSS values
to provide consistency across all your creations ðŸŽ‰

CSS can get unweildy sometimes, as new features are added and new people join the team.
It's hard to be consistent, and that's why utility/functional CSS libraries like Tailwind are growing in popularity.
SubsetCSS helps aleviate this problem in a different way by enforcing your CSS to a predefined amount of values, 
keeping everyone on the same page as a project evolves.

## Where Do I Start?

> First of all, SubsetCSS is **alpha** software, and while I'd love for everyone to use it, it might not
> be ready for most, but that is up to you to decide.

There are currently two projects:

- [Linter](https://github.com/subsetcss/linter)
- [VSCode Language Server (autocomplete)](https://github.com/subsetcss/vscode-language-server)

Both can be used together. One is for enforcing the "rules" and the other is to help write those
rules without having to look at your config.

To start have a look at the setup guide for the Linter.
