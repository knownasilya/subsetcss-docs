SubsetCSS is all about limiting yourself and/or your team to a subset of CSS values
to provide consistency across all your creations ðŸŽ‰

## Where Do I Start?

> First of all, SubsetCSS is **alpha** software, and while I'd love for everyone to use it, it might not
> be ready for most, but that is up to you to decide.

There are currently two projects:

- [Linter](https://github.com/subsetcss/linter)
- [VSCode Language Server (autocomplete)](https://github.com/subsetcss/vscode-language-server)

Both can be used together. One is for enforcing the "rules" and the other is to help write those
rules without having to look at your config.

To start have a look at the setup guide for the Linter.
